# Product Context: Hoddler

## Purpose
Hoddler addresses the challenges cryptocurrency traders face in tracking their trading activities and portfolio performance. By integrating directly with the Binance API, it provides a comprehensive view of a trader's cryptocurrency investments without requiring manual data entry or spreadsheet management.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Fragmented Trading Information
Cryptocurrency traders often struggle to maintain a holistic view of their trading activities across multiple cryptocurrencies. Hoddler consolidates this information by automatically importing trade data from Binance, providing a single source of truth for all trading activities.

### 2. Complex Performance Analysis
Calculating accurate profit/loss metrics and understanding trading patterns can be complex and time-consuming. Hoddler automates these calculations, providing real-time statistics on portfolio performance, including:
- Current price of cryptocurrencies
- Total balance of holdings
- Average purchase price
- Profit/loss percentage

### 3. Lack of Visual Context
Making informed trading decisions requires understanding historical price movements and previous trading activities. Hoddler visualizes this data through:
- Interactive candlestick charts showing price history
- Markers indicating buy/sell points
- Daily trading activity summaries

### 4. Real-time Market Monitoring
Cryptocurrency markets move quickly, making it difficult to stay updated on current prices and portfolio value. Hoddler provides real-time data through the Binance API, ensuring traders have the most current information for decision-making.
